The technology for electric cars is available, but the required infrastructure (sufficient opportunities for charging or exchanging batteries) is not. A typical electric family car has a range of 150 – 250 km on a full set of batteries, which makes them quite suited for small and densely populated countries. Furthermore, electric cars are the ideal mobile electricity storage at night, if they are plugged in and the charge they hold is remote controlled.
<br/><br/>
If you want to include hybrid cars in your scenario, you could assume that one fully electric car is equivalent to three plug-in hybrid cars with range extenders. These are electric cars that can be charged from the grid, but have limited battery capacity. A range extender is a small gasoline engine that re-charges the battery after about 50 - 60 km. 
<br/><br/>
Do not forget that the electricity still needs to be generated. If this is done with wind power, electric cars contribute strongly to a more sustainable society, but less so when coal power is used.

Hydrogen cars (in the ETM) are fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). Hydrogen in consumer vehicles is stored at a very high pressure of 700 bar in order to ensure a long driving range (of typically 500 km).

Each unit can operate at any load between <1% and 100% without loss of output efficiency. Each unit can also increase its output from 0 to 100% in ~2 minutes, and start delivering power to the grid within 30 seconds of being started, regardless of its off time.

a process of capturing CO<sub>2</sub> directly from the ambient air using electricity. If

The black bars in the graph indicate margins of uncertainty in costs due to efficiency bandwidth. The purpose of the graph is to clarify the distribution of costs among the various cost items: systems with higher CAPEX recover costs at low OPEX, higher efficiency and therefore smaller margin of uncertainty.
